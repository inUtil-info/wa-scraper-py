This examples are using functions from the `wascraper` module to perform various operations related to WhatsApp account information.

The example.py file shows how to check if a phone number is registered, fetchs profile information, checks if an account is a business account, 
gathers business information, fetchs profile picture URL and detects objects in a profile picture. 

The example2.py file imports the cv2 and numpy libraries and uses the BytesIO and Image classes from the io and PIL libraries respectively. 
It uses the wa_profilepic and wa_picobj functions from the `wascraper` module to fetch the profile picture and detect objects in the profile 
picture of a WhatsApp account associated with a phone number.

The code starts by setting the API key and the phone number, and then uses the wa_profilepic function to fetch the profile picture in PNG format 
and with a high quality setting. The binary data of the picture is then passed to the BytesIO class to be read as a byte stream, and is then converted 
into a numpy array using Image.open. The image is then converted from BGR to RGB format using cv2.cvtColor.

Next, the code uses the wa_picobj function to detect objects in the profile picture and stores the result in the result variable. 

The detected_value variable is then set to the value of the 'detected' key in the result dictionary. The code then displays a message showing the objects detected in the picture.

Finally, the image is displayed using the cv2.imshow function and the user is prompted to press the ESC key to close the window. 

The code then exits and all windows are destroyed using sys.exit and cv2.destroyAllWindows functions respectively.

The code uses an API key to access the information, but you can customize it to access the free endpoints of the api service.
